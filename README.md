##IoT incorporates the digital and physical attributes to optimize the regular tasks involved in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), smart grids, smart cities and IIoT [1]. The IIoT was introduced to improve the communication between industrial and consumer-based applications. ICS is among the Critical Infrastructures (CIs) that highly rely on IoT networks and aim to increase the profitability and production of Industry 4.0. The complexity of ICS is evident in the distribution of industrial services and the adoption of industrialized techniques, including in manufacturing industries, water treatment plants, gas pipelines, and power plants[2]. The role of cybersecurity is more significant as the contribution of IIoT makes a greater impact on the growth of business operations. However, the escalating number of devices involved in IIoT networks raises concerns about safeguarding ICS, becoming a
